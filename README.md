# Book lists for STEM subjects
This project is a list of freely available books that can be found online. Each Book listed can be used for its corresponding course, and there is little overlap
for the subject matter of each book. This is a growing project that hopefully will expand to numerous subjects. These subjects are meant for a student unsure about which field
to enter, and how to study the subject affordably. Hopefully we can eventually create simple exams which test the student's aptitude in the subject. This could one day be placed on 
a person's resume. 

# TODO:
- Add Corresponding Courses for each book
- Add Book Lists for Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering
- Add Book List for Biology
- Add Book List for Electrical Engineering
- Add Book List for English
- Add Book List for History

# Future: 
- Develop Project Oriented Aptitude Tests which provide evidence for a student's understanding of each book. Each Project should incorporate material from 70% of the book in
order to demonstrate the student has obtained an understanding of the material.
